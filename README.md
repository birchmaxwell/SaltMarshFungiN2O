# SaltMarshFungiN2O
This repository was created for the paper titled, "Nitrous oxide production and isotopologue composition by fungi isolated from salt marsh sediments", by Birch Maxwell Lazo-Murphy and colleagues.

Data can be found in the excel file above. 
N2O and CO2 values in this table are in parts per million and were complied from raw reads and assosiated standard curves, which is described in the methods section.

Note that this code has several dependancies and was done with R version - 4.2.1. All packages have been updated to ensure compatibility between between package version and R version (as of November, 2022). Also note that for this code to successfully run each package must be installed to your local drive. Steps to do this are laid out with in the R file, which includes annonation between sections.
